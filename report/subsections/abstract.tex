Our project compares the results of localizing a robot with three methods: incremental SLAM with loop closure, trajectory smoothing, and filtering with a Left Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (LI-EKF). This report evaluates each of them based on the pose error accumulated over a trajectory from the North Campus Long Term (NCLT)\cite{nclt} dataset.
